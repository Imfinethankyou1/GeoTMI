# Geometric denoising for Three-term Mutual Information maximization (GeoTMI)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The GeoTMI is a model-agnostic method to solve the practical infeasibility of high-cost 3D geometry in many other chemistry fields.
The aim of GeoTMI is maximazation of the mutual information between high-cost 3D geometries, correspoding quntum chemical properties, and easy-to-obtain geometries.
